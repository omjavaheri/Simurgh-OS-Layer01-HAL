//! interrupt.rs — ARM64
//!
//! Implements `hal_core::interrupt::InterruptController` for ARM64,
//! per 01-HAL-Layer.md section 3.4: "یکسان‌سازی... GIC v3/v4 (ARM64)...
//! پشت یک API واحد".
//!
//! Design:
//!   - GICv3 system register interface (ICC_* registers, accessed via
//!     MRS/MSR) is used for the CPU interface (EOI, priority, IAR read)
//!     — this is the modern, MMIO-free interface GICv3/v4 introduced
//!     specifically to avoid the MMIO overhead GICv2 required; every
//!     QEMU `virt` machine target (section 8's acceptance criteria)
//!     with `gic-version=3` (the default for recent QEMU versions)
//!     supports this.
//!   - The GIC Distributor (GICD) remains MMIO-based (there is no
//!     system-register equivalent for distributor-wide configuration
//!     like enabling/routing a specific SPI) — its base address is
//!     supplied by Device Tree / ACPI MADT GIC Distributor entry,
//!     folded in via `memory.rs`'s firmware table parsing, mirroring
//!     how hal-x86_64's interrupt.rs receives its xAPIC MMIO base.
//!   - SGIs (SGI0-15, software-generated interrupts) implement
//!     `send_ipi` — GICv3's direct equivalent of x86_64's ICR-based
//!     IPI mechanism.
