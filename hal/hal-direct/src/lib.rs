//! hal-direct
//!
//! Capability-gated direct hardware access, per 01-HAL-Layer.md section 5.
//!
//! This is the "hal-direct" half described in section 1:
//!
//!   HAL
//!    ├── hal-core      -> always active, safe, auto-detect, no config needed
//!    └── hal-direct    -> optional, capability-gated, for professional
//!                          users and driver authors
//!
//! Per section 5's pre-draft trait:
//!
//!   pub trait HalDirectAccess {
//!       fn map_mmio_region(&self, token: CapabilityToken, phys: PhysAddr, size: usize)
//!           -> Result<VirtAddr, HalError>;
//!       fn read_performance_counter(&self, token: CapabilityToken, counter: PerfCounterId) -> u64;
//!       fn pin_thread_to_core(&self, token: CapabilityToken, core_id: usize);
//!       fn set_numa_policy(&self, token: CapabilityToken, policy: NumaPolicy);
//!   }
//!
//! and the governing rule:
//!   "هیچ تابعی در hal-direct بدون CapabilityToken معتبر اجرا نمی‌شود؛
//!    صدور این token مسئولیت Security/Permission Broker در لایه ۴ است،
//!    نه HAL. HAL فقط توکن را verify می‌کند (امضا/scope چک می‌شود؛
//!    الگوریتم تایید در پیوست امنیتی لایه ۲ مشخص می‌شود)."
//!
//! ## Two layers of gating (per section 0's access path)
//!
//! Per 01-HAL-Layer.md section 0, `hal-direct` can be reached from two
//! places:
//!   1. Directly, by code linked into the same Privileged binary as the
//!      microkernel (layer 2 itself, e.g. its own performance-tuning
//!      diagnostics).
//!   2. From layer 5 (a professional application), via the path:
//!      app -> syscall to microkernel -> microkernel validates its OWN
//!      Capability (the kernel-cap type, 02-Microkernel-Layer.md
//!      section 2) -> microkernel calls the hal-direct function on the
//!      app's behalf.
//!
//! This means `CapabilityToken` here is DELIBERATELY NOT the same type
//! as the microkernel's `Capability` (kernel-cap, layer 2) — that type
//! belongs to layer 2 and hal-core/hal-direct must not depend on it
//! (dependency direction is strictly bottom-up, section 0). Instead,
//! `CapabilityToken` is a HAL-local, signed credential that the
//! Security Broker (layer 4) mints specifically for hal-direct
//! operations, passed down through the microkernel alongside its own
//! Capability check. This gives defense-in-depth: even a caller that
//! somehow reached this trait without a valid layer-2 Capability still
//! cannot perform an operation without a HAL-verifiable token scoped to
//! exactly that operation.
//!
//! The actual signature/verification ALGORITHM is explicitly left
//! open by section 5 ("الگوریتم تایید در پیوست امنیتی لایه ۲ مشخص
//! می‌شود") — this crate defines the token's SHAPE and the scope-
//! matching logic that is architecture-independent, while the
//! signature check itself is delegated to a `TokenVerifier`
//! implementation supplied by whoever wires up the Security Broker's
//! actual crypto (layer 4), so hal-direct never hardcodes an algorithm
//! that might need to change without a breaking API change here.
