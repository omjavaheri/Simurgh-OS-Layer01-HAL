//! Boot Abstraction, per 01-HAL-Layer.md section 3.5:
//!
//!   - uniform entry regardless of bootloader: UEFI (x86_64/ARM64) or
//!     SBI + Device Tree (RISC-V)
//!   - handoff of control to the microkernel via one standard Boot Info
//!     structure (NOT tied to UEFI's or Device Tree's own format)
//!
//! This is the very first hal-core type touched during boot: each
//! architecture's `boot.S` does the absolute minimum assembly needed to
//! establish a valid stack, then jumps into architecture-specific Rust
//! init code, which itself builds a `BootInfo` value and — per
//! 01-HAL-Layer.md section 0 — hands control to the microkernel via a
//! direct Rust function call (NOT IPC, since HAL and the microkernel
//! link into the same Privileged binary).
//!
//! Per section 9's boot-time no-heap philosophy: `BootInfo` and
//! everything it points to must remain valid and fixed-size until the
//! Root Task has copied whatever it needs out of it — nothing here may
//! assume a heap exists yet.
